I'm a problem solver. Every step of my journey in learning to code has been an exercise in problem solving, and it's a skill I take pride in wielding. As a kid, I picked apart knots in tangled strings. As a teen, my favorite computer games were the Myst series. As an adult, I apply that same determination and critical thinking to all areas of my life, personal and professional.

I am a creative person and I approach coding from that standpoint. I have come to enjoy coding as a creative endeavor where I can find the most effective and innovative ways to make my ideas work. Most of my hobbies involve art or writing, as well as outdoor activities such as swimming, hiking, or kayaking when it's available. I enjoy discussing and dissecting media with friends, especially if the subject matter is science fiction or fantasy.
