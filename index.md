I’m a problem solver. Every step of my journey in learning to code has been an exercise in problem solving, and it’s a skill I take pride in wielding. As a kid, I picked apart knots in tangled strings. As a teen, my favorite computer games were the notoriously challenging Myst series. As an adult, I apply that same determination and critical thinking to all areas of my life, personal and professional.

A strong developer team needs new energy from time to time. As a newly minted junior developer, my goal is to bring that new energy to a team. Learning and growing is what I am most enthusiastic about, I thrive in environments where I can expand and grow my skillset, and I am excited for a chance to be on a team where I can be part of delivering innovative solutions through solid code engineering. In the process of teaching myself full-stack web development, I have come to greatly enjoy the experience of discovering new ways to build my ideas into strong code. While developing the "Sunflame Mountain" project for my portfolio, I had many such experiences; the most noteworthy of which was developing the ledge-climbing solution for the site's game feature, which required me to dive deep in the Phaser framework's documentation and to get creative with how I utilized Phaser's methods.

I am a creative person and I approach coding from that standpoint. I enjoy coding as a creative endeavor where I can find the most effective and innovative ways to make my ideas work. In my personal time I'm a versatile artist, with a love of writing, drawing, sewing, and crafting; I also jump at the chance for outdoor activities such as swimming, hiking, or kayaking. I enjoy discussing and analyzing media with friends, especially if the subject matter is science fiction or fantasy.
